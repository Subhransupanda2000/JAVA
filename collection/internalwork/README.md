# What is the internal data structure used in linked hashset?
* The LinkedHashSet class in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework and is implemented using a combination of a hash table and a linked list. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the order in which they were inserted (insertion order), in addition to using a hash table for efficient element retrieval.
Here's an overview of the internal data structure used in LinkedHashSet:
* Hash Table:
Like HashSet, LinkedHashSet uses a hash table to store its elements. The hash code of each element is used to determine its bucket location in the hash table.
* Linked List:
In addition to the hash table, LinkedHashSet maintains a doubly-linked list of elements to preserve the order in which elements were inserted. This linked list allows for iterating through the elements in the order of insertion.
* Hashing:
When you add an element to a LinkedHashSet using the add method, the hash code of the element is computed to determine the bucket in the hash table. The element is then added to the linked list for that bucket.
* Performance:
The use of a hash table allows for constant-time average complexity for basic operations (add, remove, contains), assuming a good hash function and a well-distributed set of elements.
The linked list allows for efficient iteration through the elements in the order they were inserted.
* Key Characteristics:
Maintains insertion order: Iterating through a LinkedHashSet will return the elements in the order in which they were inserted.
Unique elements: Like HashSet, LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicate elements.
# What is the internal data structure used in treeset?
* The TreeSet class in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework and is implemented using a Red-Black tree data structure. A Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures efficient and logarithmic time complexity for key-based operations.
Here's an overview of the internal data structure used in TreeSet:
* Red-Black Tree:
TreeSet uses a Red-Black tree to store its elements. A Red-Black tree is a binary search tree with additional properties that ensure it remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
* Binary Search Tree Properties:
Like any binary search tree, each node in the Red-Black tree has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The left child's key is less than the node's key, and the right child's key is greater.
* Balancing:
The Red-Black tree maintains balance by enforcing additional properties such as color-coding nodes as red or black and ensuring that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.
* Performance:
The use of a self-balancing binary search tree allows TreeSet to achieve logarithmic time complexity for key-based operations like add, remove, and contains, making these operations efficient even for large sets of elements.
Key Characteristics:
* Sorted order: Elements are stored in sorted order based on their natural ordering or a provided comparator.
Unique elements: Like other set implementations in Java, TreeSet does not allow duplicate elements.
# What is the internal data structure used in hashset?
* he working of a HashSet is based on a hash table, which is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys (in this case, the elements being stored) to values (in this case, their positions in the table). The hash function takes an input (the element) and returns a hash code, which is an integer value. This hash code is used as an index to store the element in an array-like structure, often referred to as a bucket.
HashSet internally uses HashMap to store itâ€™s elements. Whenever you create a HashSet object, one HashMap object associated with it is also created. This HashMap object is used to store the elements you enter in the HashSet. The elements you add into HashSet are stored as keys of this HashMap object. The value associated with those keys will be a constant
